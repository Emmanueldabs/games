    Volleyball Essay In English
    Volleyball, as mentioned in the above section, involves two teams of six members each. The teams are separated on the court by a net. The teams have to "bat" the ball using only their hands to pass the ball back and forth over the net. The game aims to pass the ball onto the next team without letting it touch the ground.

    The receiving team must prevent the ball from falling on the ground and pass it onto the court of the opponent. Each team gets to touch the ball a maximum of 3 times amongst the team members before passing it to the other team. However, an individual player can only touch a ball once before passing.
    
    The rally continues unless a team makes the ball fall on the ground of the opposition or one team commits a fault and loses. Some faults can include touching the net, more than the allowed number of touches by the team or a player of the team, stepping outside the court boundaries, and so on.
    
    Each time a team wins the serve, they must rotate. The entire team is required to switch the sides moving in a clockwise manner with one player moving in a front line whereas another player moving to the backline.
